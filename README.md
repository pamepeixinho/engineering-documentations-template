# Architecture decisions

<p style="color:pink">The main idea is to have centralized documentation about engineering for the company. </p>

So, we have two folders:

- Architecture decisions: is the place for documentation of arch critiques and decisions, proposals and discussions

- Feature docs: is a proposal for a place that is going to have all the tech info centralized by feature.

## Tech Debits

We're going to centralize also the tech debits documentation cross-company in the same place, using the *issues* from GitHub.
